# Degoogle Mirrors

If you host a mirror, let me know through an Issue or PR so it can be added to the community mirrors list. It would be prefered if your mirror is auto-updating.

Official mirrors are the main sources and are maintained by me (@tycrek). Community mirrors are other Git instances run by other users that I can't control.

## Official mirrors

- [GitHub repo](https://github.com/tycrek/degoogle)
- [GitHub Pages](https://degoogle.jmoore.dev) (I am using my personal domain as some firewalls block GitHub)
- [r/Privacy wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/privacy/wiki/de-google) (automatically updated using GitHub Actions)
