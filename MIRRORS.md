# Degoogle Mirrors

Official mirrors are managed by me ([@tycrek](https://github.com/tycrek)). Community mirrors are Git instances run by other users that I can't control (they may be out of date as well).

## Official mirrors

- [GitHub repo](https://github.com/tycrek/degoogle)
- [r/Privacy wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/privacy/wiki/de-google) (automatically updated using GitHub Actions)

## Community mirrors

- [Cgit mirror](https://git.mirkodi.eu/mirk0dex/degoogle) from [@mirk0dex (Cgit)](https://git.mirkodi.eu/mirk0dex)
