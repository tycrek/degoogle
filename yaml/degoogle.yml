        Open-source feature-rich calculator. App itself is no longer in development, but the developer does [encourage pull requests](https://github.com/tranleduy2000/ncalc#calculator-n---powerful-calculator-for-android). I've used it frequently and it works great. Not on F-Droid, but a 3rd party play store can probably find it; or the APK's are available as releases on GitHub. You can also compile from source.

        Due to Google's  [recent acquisition of FitBit](https://outline.com/tsJCYN), it is recommended to avoid using FitBit. Instead, check out this [list of smart watches](https://asteroidos.org/install/) supported by Asteroid OS (See Wear OS in [Operating systems](#operating-systems)). Thanks @ribtoks
