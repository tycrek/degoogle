# Contributing

## General rules

1. **English only** for issues & pull requests.
2. **Do not edit README.md!** This file is automatically generated. Instead, use:
   - [`yaml/`](https://github.com/tycrek/degoogle/tree/master/yaml) for structured data
   - [`md/`](https://github.com/tycrek/degoogle/tree/master/md) for regular text
3. Personal opinions will **not** be considered. Instead, provide detailed links as supporting evidence.
4. **Use the templates** when submitting an Issue or Pull Request. Blank Issues/PRs are not allowed.

## How to submit a change

### A: I am not familiar with GitHub or Pull Requests

1. Open a [new Issue](https://github.com/tycrek/degoogle/issues/new/choose).
2. Select a template to use. If in doubt, use **Other**.
3. Fill out the information to the best of your ability.
4. When you are finished, click **Submit new issue**.

### B: I have used GitHub Pull Requests

1. Create your Pull Request with your changes.
   - Remember to **not** edit README.md!
   - As with Issues, fill out the template as best you can.
2. For PR's relating to alternatives, you must also follow the steps above to create an Issue for discussion. Simple PR's that are unrelated to a specific alternative may not require an Issue. If in doubt, create an **Other** Issue.
