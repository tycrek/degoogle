- name: HTTPS Everywhere
  url: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/https-everywhere
  text: |
    Many sites on the web offer some limited support for encryption over HTTPS, but make it difficult to use. For instance, they may default to unencrypted HTTP, or fill encrypted pages with links that go back to the unencrypted site. The HTTPS Everywhere extension fixes these problems by rewriting all requests to these sites to HTTPS. Note: EFF is preparing to deprecate the HTTPS Everywhere, check out this [blog post](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/09/https-actually-everywhere).
