- name: HTTPS Everywhere
  url: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/https-everywhere
  text: |
    Many sites on the web offer some limited support for encryption over HTTPS, but make it difficult to use. For instance, they may default to unencrypted HTTP, or fill encrypted pages with links that go back to the unencrypted site. The HTTPS Everywhere extension fixes these problems by rewriting all requests to these sites to HTTPS. Note: EFF is preparing to deprecate the HTTPS Everywhere, check out this [blog post](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/09/https-actually-everywhere).

- name: minerBlock
  url: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/minerblock-origin
  text: |
    MinerBlock is an efficient browser extension that focuses on blocking browser-based cryptocurrency miners all over the web. This extension uses two different approaches to block miners. The first one is based on blocking requests/scripts loaded from a blacklist, this is the traditional approach adopted by most ad-blockers and other mining blockers. The other approach which makes MinerBlock more efficient against cryptojacking is detecting potential mining behavior inside loaded scripts and kills them immediately. This makes the extension able to block inline scripts as well as miners running through proxies. Source code available on [GitHub](https://github.com/xd4rker/MinerBlock).
