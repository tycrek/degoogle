        does [encourage pull requests](https://github.com/tranleduy2000/ncalc#calculator-n---powerful-calculator-for-android).
        I've used it frequently and it works great. Not on F-Droid, but a 3rd party play store can probably find it;
        or the APK's are available as releases on GitHub. You can also compile from source.

        Jitsi is an open-source secure video conferencing platform. No account is needed to use it,
        simply enter a Room Name to join or host a meeting. The host is able to kick rogue users from
        the call. Works directly in your browser, with apps available for iOS and Android. It is not
        necessary to self-host, but self-hosting is an option for those who wish to. Very low latency
        and easy to set up. A free public server is available at [meet.jit.si](https://meet.jit.si).
