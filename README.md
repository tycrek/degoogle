# Browser extensions

| ---- | ----------- |
| [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin) ![Mozilla Add-on](https://img.shields.io/amo/users/ublock-origin?style=flat-square) | uBlock Origin is not an "ad blocker", it's a wide-spectrum content blocker with CPU and memory efficiency as a primary feature. |
| [Privacy Badger](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-badger17) ![Mozilla Add-on](https://img.shields.io/amo/users/privacy-badger17?style=flat-square) | Privacy Badger automatically learns to block invisible trackers. Instead of keeping lists of what to block, Privacy Badger learns by watching which domains appear to be tracking you as you browse the Web. |
| [Decentraleyes](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/decentraleyes) ![Mozilla Add-on](https://img.shields.io/amo/users/decentraleyes?style=flat-square) | Protects you against tracking through "free", centralized, content delivery. It prevents a lot of requests from reaching networks like Google Hosted Libraries, and serves local files to keep sites from breaking. Complements regular content blockers. |
| [HTTPS Everywhere](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/https-everywhere) ![Mozilla Add-on](https://img.shields.io/amo/users/https-everywhere?style=flat-square) | Many sites on the web offer some limited support for encryption over HTTPS, but make it difficult to use. For instance, they may default to unencrypted HTTP, or fill encrypted pages with links that go back to the unencrypted site. The HTTPS Everywhere extension fixes these problems by rewriting all requests to these sites to HTTPS. |
| [Cookie AutoDelete](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-autodelete) ![Mozilla Add-on](https://img.shields.io/amo/users/cookie-autodelete?style=flat-square) | Control your cookies! This WebExtension is inspired by Self Destructing Cookies. When a tab closes, any cookies not being used are automatically deleted. Whitelist the ones you trust while deleting the rest. Support for Container Tabs. |
| [DDG Privacy Essentials](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/duckduckgo-for-firefox) ![Mozilla Add-on](https://img.shields.io/amo/users/duckduckgo-for-firefox?style=flat-square) | Privacy, simplified.

You can report any website which still warns you about cookies: make a right click and choose 'Report a cookie warning' from the menu. |
| [minerBlock](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/minerblock-origin) ![Mozilla Add-on](https://img.shields.io/amo/users/minerblock-origin?style=flat-square) | MinerBlock is an efficient browser extension that focuses on blocking browser-based cryptocurrency miners all over the web. This extension uses two different approaches to block miners. The first one is based on blocking requests/scripts loaded from a blacklist, this is the traditional approach adopted by most ad-blockers and other mining blockers. The other approach which makes MinerBlock more efficient against cryptojacking is detecting potential mining behavior inside loaded scripts and kills them immediately. This makes the extension able to block inline scripts as well as miners running through proxies. Source code available on [GitHub](https://github.com/xd4rker/MinerBlock). |
| [Terms of Service; Didn't Read](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/terms-of-service-didnt-read) ![Mozilla Add-on](https://img.shields.io/amo/users/terms-of-service-didnt-read?style=flat-square) | “I have read and agree to the Terms” is the biggest lie on the web. We aim to fix that. “Terms of Service; Didn't Read” is a user rights initiative to rate and label website terms & privacy policies, from very good (class A) to very bad (class E). This extension informs you instantly of your rights online by showing an unintrusive icon in the toolbar. You can click on this icon to get summaries from the [Terms of Service; Didn't Read](https://tosdr.org/) initiative. |
| [ClearURLS](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/clearurls) ![Mozilla Add-on](https://img.shields.io/amo/users/clearurls?style=flat-square) | This extension will automatically remove tracking elements from URLs to help protect your privacy when browse through the Internet. |
| [Cloud Firewall](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cloud-firewall) ![Mozilla Add-on](https://img.shields.io/amo/users/cloud-firewall?style=flat-square) | Block connections to pages and web resources hosted in major cloud services if the user wishes to do so. Supports blocking Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and Cloudflare. |
| [CSS Exfil Protection](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/css-exfil-protection) ![Mozilla Add-on](https://img.shields.io/amo/users/css-exfil-protection?style=flat-square) | CSS Exfil is a method attackers can use to steal data from web pages using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). This plugin sanitizes and blocks any CSS rules which may be designed to steal data. |
| [Disconnect](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/disconnect) ![Mozilla Add-on](https://img.shields.io/amo/users/disconnect?style=flat-square) | Visualize and block the otherwise invisible websites that track your search and browsing history. |

| [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers) ![Mozilla Add-on](https://img.shields.io/amo/users/multi-account-containers?style=flat-square) | Firefox Multi-Account Containers lets you keep parts of your online life separated into color-coded tabs that preserve your privacy. Cookies are separated by container, allowing you to use the web with multiple identities or accounts simultaneously. |
| [Google search link fix (also Yandex)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/google-search-link-fix) ![Mozilla Add-on](https://img.shields.io/amo/users/google-search-link-fix?style=flat-square) | This extension prevents Google and Yandex search pages from modifying search result links when you click them. This is useful when copying links but it also helps privacy by preventing the search engines from recording your clicks. |
| [HTTPZ](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/httpz) ![Mozilla Add-on](https://img.shields.io/amo/users/httpz?style=flat-square) | HTTPZ is meant to be unobtrusive and lightweight, it respects your privacy, and is free of trans fats. Additionally, it is very configurable, and should be slightly more secure than some of the alternatives out there, since it has a couple of built-in defenses against SSL-stripping attacks. |
| [Link Cleaner](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/link-cleaner) ![Mozilla Add-on](https://img.shields.io/amo/users/link-cleaner?style=flat-square) | Clean URLs that are about to be visited: removes utm_* parameters; on item pages of aliexpress and amazon, removes tracking parameters; skip redirect pages of facebook, steam and reddit |

| [Skip Redirect](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/skip-redirect) ![Mozilla Add-on](https://img.shields.io/amo/users/skip-redirect?style=flat-square) | Some web pages use intermediary pages before redirecting to a final page. This add-on tries to extract the final url from the intermediary url and goes there straight away if successful. |
| [Temporary Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/temporary-containers) ![Mozilla Add-on](https://img.shields.io/amo/users/temporary-containers?style=flat-square) | Open tabs, websites, and links in automatically managed disposable containers. Containers isolate data websites store (cookies, storage, and more) from each other, enhancing your privacy and security while you browse. |
| [TrackMeNot](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/trackmenot) ![Mozilla Add-on](https://img.shields.io/amo/users/trackmenot?style=flat-square) | An artware browser add-on to protect privacy in web-search. By issuing randomized queries to common search-engines, TrackMeNot obfuscates your search profile and registers your discontent with surreptitious tracking. |
| [Redirect AMP to HTML](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/amp2html) ![Mozilla Add-on](https://img.shields.io/amo/users/amp2html?style=flat-square) | This web extension enables users to choose to opt-out of using Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) and choose to use the standard web instead. |
| [ghacks-user.js](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js/)  | This is not an extension, instead it is a Firefox `user.js` config file. This file is a template which aims to provide as much privacy and enhanced security as possible, and to reduce tracking and fingerprinting as much as possible - while minimizing any loss of functionality and breakage (but it will happen). |

# Closing remarks

It's a shame that Google, with their immense resources, power, and influence, don't see the benefits of helping people secure themselves online. Instead, they force people like us to scour the web for alternatives and convince our friends and family to do the same, while they sell off our data to the highest bidder.

Hopefully this guide can serve as a starting point for those new to privacy, or be a good refresher for the experts.

Good luck and stay safe!
