    - [Mint](https://linuxmint.com/)
    - [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/)
    - [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/) or [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) (Manjaro is objectively much easier to get running than Arch)

    - [etc etc etc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions)
- Wear OS
  - [AsteroidOS](https://asteroidos.org/) - **14-eyes** - The cleanest (and only) open-source alternative for Wear OS. Make sure you buy a watch that supports it!
- Android Auto
  - *Help requested!*
- Google TV/Android TV
  - [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/) - It's incredibly powerful and backed by one of the strongest communities around. Tons of plugins to do nearly anything you want. Software installs on nearly any platform.

## Desktop applications

- Chrome
  - [Ungoogled Chromium](https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium) - Chromium (which Chrome and countless other browsers are built on top of) is one of the cleanest and light-weight browsers available. This version cuts out all the Google crap.
  - [Firefox](https://firefox.com/) - Built by Mozilla. Huge extension library; great for privacy.
  - [Waterfox](https://www.waterfox.net/) - **5-eyes** - Based on Firefox, but **64-bit only** with an emphasis on speed and privacy. Has a "classic" version built off older Firefox for legacy extension support and also an "alpha" version built off Quantum. It doesn't collect any telemetry and also removes Pocket from the alpha release. Project is run by [Alex Kontos](https://github.com/MrAlex94/) and is constantly in active development. Looks very clean and fast. Android versions are in the works too. **UPDATE:** @Nudin pointed out in Issue #85 that Waterfox is now [apart of System1](https://www.waterfox.net/blog/waterfox-has-joined-system1/).
  - [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/) - Privacy-focused browser. Appears to be very customizable and feature-rich.
  - [Brave](https://brave.com/) - Another very popular privacy-focused browser. Boasts "up to 8x faster than Chrome and Safari". Automatically blocks ads and trackers so you don't have to.
  - [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/) - Firefox-based browser routed through the onion network. Automatically has a few privacy extensions installed (such as HTTPS Everywhere). Be careful using it in public though, as it *can* look like a pretty suspicious piece of software. Available for Windows, Linux, macOS, and Android.
- Earth
  - Different from Maps Satellite in the sense that Earth has tons of complex features that require desktop software to be installed.
  - [KDE Marble](https://kde.org/applications/education/org.kde.marble) - Strong alternative for G Earth. Currently only on Linux, but is being ported to other platforms. Thanks to @PopeRigby
- Android Studio (not specifically for Android development, just in general)
  - [VSCodium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium) - VSCodium is VSCode but without all the Microsoft telemetry and branding.
  - Text editors:
    - [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) - Open-source text editor. Thanks @moon-chilled
    - [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) - Another open-source text editor. Thanks @moon-chilled

## Mobile applications (mobile apps installable from stores)

When searching for replacements, check the alternative stores (such as F-Droid) before checking the Play Store.

- Play Store
  - [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) - Catalogue of FOSS apps for Android. Easy to install and keeps track of updates. Also has a browser version if you don't want to install the app.
  - [Aptoide](https://www.aptoide.com/) - Marketplace for Android apps. Publishers/developers manage their own stores rather than a centralized market such as Google Play Store.
  - [Yalp Store](https://github.com/yeriomin/YalpStore) - Yalp downloads Play Store apps as APK files. Helpful if you want to stay away from the Play Store, but require an app that is only available there.
  - [APKMirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/) - An online library of user-uploaded APK files. Helpful if you need a specific older version of an app or don't want to download it through Google Play.
  - [Aurora Store](https://gitlab.com/AuroraOSS/AuroraStore) - Aurora Store is ~~simply a fork of the Yalp Store~~ no longer a fork of Yalp, but is now its own project (see their [readme](https://gitlab.com/AuroraOSS/AuroraStore/blob/master/README.md)). It can also utilize [microG](https://microg.org/) if you wish to use *very minimal* Google Play services. Thanks @RefexHD for clarifying.
  - [Fossdroid](https://fossdroid.com/) - Uses the same library as F-Droid, but with a modern UI similar to that of the Play Store and the ability to view apps by popularity.
  - [G-Droid](https://gitlab.com/gdroid/gdroidclient/) - Also uses the F-Droid repo but with a different UI.
  - [APKGrabber](https://github.com/hemker/apkgrabber) - Fork of [APKUpdater](https://github.com/rumboalla/apkupdater). Both are great tools for avoiding app stores (on Android).
  - [Aurora Droid](https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/app-aurora-droid-fdroid-client-t3932663) - Yet another F-Droid client, potentially has a few bugs (thanks u/OfficialJohnGL4)
- Chrome (Android)
  - [Fennec F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.mozilla.fennec_fdroid/) - A privacy-focused version of Firefox Android available on F-Droid. It's focused on removing any proprietary bits found in official Mozilla's builds. (thanks u/SupremeLisper)
  - [Bromite](https://www.bromite.org/) - Privacy-focused/open-source build of Chromium with built-in ad blocking. (thanks u/SupremeLisper)
- Calculator
  - [Simple Calculator](https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools/Simple-Calculator) - Also part of the SMT project. Available on F-Droid.
  - [Calculator N+](https://github.com/tranleduy2000/ncalc) (or NCalc+) - Open-source feature-rich calculator. App itself is no longer in development, but the developer does [encourage pull requests](https://github.com/tranleduy2000/ncalc#calculator-n---powerful-calculator-for-android). I've used it frequently and it works great. Not on F-Droid, but a 3rd party play store can probably find it; or the APK's are available as releases on GitHub. You can also compile from source.
- Calendar
  - [Fruux (mobile app)](https://fruux.com/) - Same service from above provides an Android app.
  - [Etar](https://github.com/xsoh/Etar-Calendar) - Open-source material design Calendar that integrates with the Android Calendar API. If you have a CalDAV/CardDAV server, I recommend using [DAVx5](https://www.davx5.com/) to sync with it. Available from F-Droid. Also look at [ICSx5](https://icsx5.bitfire.at/), another WebDav/CalDav client that can integrate with calendar apps. Also available from F-Droid. Thanks @je-vv for ICSx5.
- Camera
  - [Open Camera](https://opencamera.sourceforge.io/) - Open source camera for Android. Thanks @je-vv
- Clock
  - [Clock +](https://github.com/philliphsu/ClockPlus) - Open-source Alarm clock, timer, and stop watch. Available from F-Droid.
  - [Simple Alarm Clock](https://github.com/yuriykulikov/AlarmClock) - Exactly as it's name says; simple alarm clock yet adds many improvements over other apps. No dock mode or world clock.
  - [Insane Alarm!](https://github.com/RIAEvangelist/insane-alarm) - Developer states that he had "spent a night out with the boys and drank a bit too much but needed to be up in the morning". So, he made the loudest alarm clock possible based off an emergency alarm from when he was in the military. This app doesn't mess around, use it wisely.
- Contacts
  - [Fruux (mobile app)](https://fruux.com/) - Fruux *also* provides a contacts app.
  - [Simple Contacts](https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools/Simple-Contacts) - Open-source. Part of the [Simple Mobile Tools](https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools) project. Available from F-Droid.

  - [OpenBoard](https://github.com/dslul/openboard) - New 100% FOSS keyboard, based on AOSP. Similar to "Simple Keyboard". Thanks @Glitchy-Tozier
- Drive
  - [ownCloud Android](https://github.com/owncloud/android) - ownCloud Android client.
  - [Nextcloud Android](https://github.com/nextcloud/android) - Nextcloud Android client.

  - *All Drive replacements are available on F-Droid*
- Gmail
  - [Protonmail](https://protonmail.com/support/knowledge-base/android/) - Can be downloaded from the Play Store, but may work with one of the store replacements above (such as Yalp).
  - [Tutanota](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/de.tutao.tutanota/) - **14-eyes** - Client available from F-Droid.

  - [Zoho Mail](https://www.zoho.com/mail/ios-android-apps.html) - Also on the Play Store but other stores may work too.

- Keep (or any stock note-taking app)
  - [Notepad](https://github.com/farmerbb/Notepad) - Open-source and available from F-Droid. Supports Markdown and HTML. Very clean and feature-rich. *Offline only*.
  - [Joplin](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin) for Android - Scroll down on the GitHub page until you reach the Android download links. No F-Droid repo, but you can download the APK directly instead of using the Play Store.
  - [Standard Notes](https://standardnotes.org/) - Encrypted note storage with loads of features.
  - [Omni Notes](https://omninotes.app/) - Very feature rich, open-source, material design notes app. Very active development. Available on F-Droid.
  - [Carnet](https://github.com/PhieF/CarnetDocumentation) - I had some trouble finding info on this one. Looks like it has pretty seamless/painless ownCloud and NextCloud integration. Also available on F-Droid.
  - [Markor](https://gsantner.net/project/markor.html) - Open-source notes/to-do app for Android. Supports Markdown editing. Available on F-Droid. App is 100% offline, as stated on the [GitHub README](https://github.com/gsantner/markor#privacy).

- Maps/Waze
  - Don't use Waze. It's owned by Google.
  - [Maps](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.github.axet.maps/) - Available from F-Droid. Open-source navigation app based on MAPS.ME. Searching for addresses doesn't always work and finding businesses can be a slight hassle, but overall one of the better apps I've used.
  - [OsmAnd](https://osmand.net/) - OpenStreetMap for Android. (thanks u/masao77)
    - As OsmAnd is primarily crowdsourced, many regions may not be totally accurate. If you would like to help improve OpenStreetMap and OsmAnd, check out [StreetComplete](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/StreetComplete). It is available from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/de.westnordost.streetcomplete/).

# Closing remarks

It's a shame that Google, with their immense resources, power, and influence, don't see the benefits of helping people secure themselves online. Instead, they force people like us to scour the web for alternatives and convince our friends and family to do the same, while they sell off our data to the highest bidder.

Hopefully this guide can serve as a starting point for those new to privacy, or be a good refresher for the experts.

Good luck and stay safe!
