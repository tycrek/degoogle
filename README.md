## Desktop apps

#### Chrome

| Name | Eyes | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| [Ungoogled Chromium](https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium) |  | Chromium (which Chrome and countless other browsers are built on top of) is one of the cleanest and light-weight browsers available. This version cuts out all the Google crap. |
| [Firefox](https://firefox.com/) |  | Built by Mozilla, "The Privacy Company". Huge extension library; great for privacy. |
| [Waterfox](https://www.waterfox.net/) | **5-eyes** | Based on Firefox, but **64-bit only** with an emphasis on speed and privacy. Has a "classic" version built off older Firefox for legacy extension support and also an "alpha" version built off Quantum. It doesn't collect any telemetry and also removes Pocket from the alpha release. Project is run by [Alex Kontos](https://github.com/MrAlex94/) and is constantly in active development. Looks very clean and fast. Android versions are in the works too. **UPDATE:** @Nudin pointed out in Issue #85 that Waterfox is now [apart of System1](https://www.waterfox.net/blog/waterfox-has-joined-system1/). |
| [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/) |  | Privacy-focused browser. Appears to be very customizable and feature-rich. |
| [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/) |  | Firefox-based browser routed through the onion network. Automatically has a few privacy extensions installed (such as HTTPS Everywhere). Be careful using it in public though, as it *can* look like a pretty suspicious piece of software. Available for Windows, Linux, macOS, and Android. |

# The lighter side

- Movies and TV I recommend:
  - *Snowden (2016)* - Based on the true story of Edward Snowden, the CIA/NSA/etc whistleblower. Directed by Oliver Stone.
  - *Deep Web (2015)* - Documentary (narrated by Keanu Reeves) about Ross Ulbricht aka. Dread Pirate Roberts and the infamous "Silk Road" dark market. Directed by Alex Winter.
  - *Mr. Robot* - Hacker-drama starring Rami Malek. Producers hired actual hackers as consultants to ensure the show is as accurate as possible; real-world tools used in the show.
  - *Silicon Valley* - Satirical tech comedy about a compression startup struggling to take off in Silicon Valley, California.
- Podcasts:
  - [Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/) (by Jack Rhysider) - Highlights real-life hackers and their stories. Covers privacy topics a fair bit.
  - The WAN Show (Linus Tech Tips) - Not specifically privacy, but they cover all sorts of tech news.
  - [The Privacy, Security, & OSINT Show](https://inteltechniques.com/podcast.html) - "This weekly podcast presents ideas to help you become digitally invisible, stay secure from cyber threats, and make you a better online investigator."
  - [Security Now!](https://www.grc.com/SecurityNow.htm) - "TechTV's Leo Laporte and I spend somewhat shy of two hours each week to discuss important issues of personal computer security." (Thanks u/Abaddon182)
- Other:
  - [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/) - They have comics for *everything*.
  - System32 Comics [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/system32comics/) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/System32Comics/) - Comedic computer comics.

# Closing remarks

It's a shame that Google, with their immense resources, power, and influence, don't see the benefits of helping people secure themselves online. Instead, they force people like us to scour the web for alternatives and convince our friends and family to do the same, while they sell off our data to the highest bidder.

Hopefully this guide can serve as a starting point for those new to privacy, or be a good refresher for the experts.

Good luck and stay safe!
