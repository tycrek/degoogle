# Cutting Google out of your life (2019)
### *I don't have anything to hide, but I don't have anything to show you either.*
# Introduction

*Huge* thanks to [AlternativeTo](https://alternativeto.net/). Without them and their users, this project would be significantly more difficult, if not impossible.

Before reading this guide, I highly recommend reading through [Privacy Tools](https://www.privacytools.io/) and [ethical.net](https://ethical.net/) (thanks u/yieldingTemporarily).

# Contributing
If you want to help out with the project, here are some ideas:

- **iOS app alternatives!** I don't have an iOS device to find alternatives with. I would highly appreciate any help with this.
- Clean up and improve the Markdown
- Provide more information on services with little info
- Suggest new services
- Hosting a mirror or cloning the [repo](https://github.com/tycrek/degoogle)
- Literally anything relating to any part of this guide, whether it's Google related or not

You can do these by:

- Submitting Issues/Pull Requests on the [GitHub page](https://github.com/tycrek/degoogle)
- (Removed contact info, please only use GitHub)

Please specifiy if you wish to remain anonymous or if you want your Reddit username added to a contributors list.

If you host a mirror, let me know and I can add it to a mirrors list on GitHub or Pastebin.

**Want to help out in another way?**
- **Share** this guide with your friends, family, and coworkers. Let them know *why* privacy matters and *why* they should care about it. Don't force it on them, but carefully ease them into it and don't scare them away from staying secure.
- **Donate** to non-profit organizations that support online privacy and security (see the r/privacy sidebar)

# Replacements/alternatives
## Notes, disclaimers, and rules
**Please read:** Instead of last year where any replacement I found was included, I will specifically focus on *privacy-focused* replacements this year.

1. Once again, replacements are based off [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Google_products)
2. Currencies in USD unless otherwise stated
3. This year I've decided ***not*** to include products from companies such as Microsoft, Apple, Yahoo, Amazon, etc. This includes companies/apps/services they own.
4. Controversial services will have a disclaimer attached if needed.
5. 5-eyes, 9-eyes, and 14-eyes services **will** be listed, and marked as such. This means the company, not the server IP.
    - 5: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, UK, USA
    - 9: Denmark, France, Netherlands, Norway
    - 14: Germany, Belgium, Italy, Sweden, Spain
    - [What are 5-eyes, 9-eyes, and 14-eyes?](https://restoreprivacy.com/5-eyes-9-eyes-14-eyes/)
6. I will still be adding personal notes if I want to.
7. Google offers a ridiculous amount of small services. I'm only focusing on the important ones for now.
9. If you see *Help requested!*, it means I couldn't find any privacy-focused services and am asking for suggestions.

## Web-based products

- Search (web, images)
  - [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) - **5-eyes** -  One of the best privacy-focused search engines. Domain is hosted in USA which could potentially be problematic for some. *Editor note: I've used this for the past ~5 months and haven't had any major issues. Instant Answers are incredibly helpful for programming).*
  - [Startpage](https://www.startpage.com/) - **9-eyes** - Another privacy search engine that claims to not track any of your data. They operate servers in both USA and Europe.
  - [searx.me](https://searx.me/) - [Open-source](https://github.com/asciimoo/searx) (thanks for clarification u/Sheezdudeln) privacy search engine. Domain hosted in Germany.

  - [Swisscows](https://swisscows.ch/) - A Swiss search engine that offers a unique search experience for the web, images, videos, music, and more. They are currently funding a mail service. Read through their [datacenter](https://swisscows.ch/en/datacenter) about page, it's really interesting.
  - [Ecosia](https://www.ecosia.org/) - **14-eyes** - Search engine that plants trees.
  - [Mojeek](https://www.mojeek.com/) - **5-eyes** - Unlike other privacy search engines which act as a "middle man" between you and Google/Bing/Yahoo, Mojeek has their own crawler and index. The results aren't as complete as some of the others, but it is still impressive and they are actively building their index to include more results with better accuracy.
- Images
  - *See above. All provide some form of image search.*
- YouTube
  - [PeerTube](https://joinpeertube.org/en/) - Decentralized video hosting network. Still quite small, but is growing and has a dedicated community.
  - [BitChute](https://www.bitchute.com/) - Also P2P, but not decentralized. Due to it being proprietary, if BitChute goes down then the whole thing goes down (unlike PeerTube). (thanks u/up-sky-7)
  - [DTube](https://d.tube/) - Looks very similar to YouTube. Advertised as "first crypt-decentralized video-platform". Built on Steemit and IPFS.

  - [Invidious](https://invidio.us/) - An [open-source](https://github.com/omarroth/invidious) front-end alternative to YouTube. Seems to work pretty well from my experience so far, and it hasn't triggered *anything* on my adblocker/privacy extensions. Also offers downloads in many formats for videos (including `.vtt` subtitles).
  - [Hooktube](https://hooktube.com/) - A slightly better way to use actual YouTube. (Use as a "last resort")
- News
  - r/news - Includes both USA and International.
  - r/worldnews - International news. Typically excludes news specific to the USA.
  - *Most country/state/provine subreddit's act as local news hubs as well.*

  - *Help requested!*

  - [Fruux](https://fruux.com/) - **14-eyes** - Open-source calendar using "sabre/dav" (open-source WebDAV, CardDAV, and CalDAV). They mention privacy quite a bit on their site. Very large number of features, and supports nearly every device: Windows, iOS, Linux, Android, BlackBerry, SailFish, and also a Webapp for browsers.

  - [Zoho](https://www.zoho.com/) - I mentioned Zoho above for G Suite, so here they are again.

  - [Etherpad](https://etherpad.org/) - Self-hosted collaborative editor. Does not use the browser. Not the greatest interface, but it's open-source and you have full control over who can see your data.
  - [Cryptee](https://crypt.ee/) - Open-source and privacy focused photo and document storage/editing. Based in Estonia, so your files are outside the reach of any 14-eyes country. They don't even require an email address to sign up.

  - [Sia](https://sia.tech/) - Fully decentralized cloud storage.
  - [Tresorit](https://tresorit.com/) - Primarily meant for businesses, but offeres a free version for individuals as well. (thanks u/xNick26)
  - *Editor note: I'm not including MEGA. I do not recommend MEGA. It's far too controversial and far too difficult to figure out who actually owns the service. Also, it's a 5-eyes.*
- Hangouts
  - [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) - Telegram is one of the biggest names out there for secure communication. Previously based in Russia, the company has since moved to Dubai.
  - [Signal](https://signal.org/) - Whistleblower and privacy advocate Edward Snowden recommends Signal.
  - [Tox](https://tox.chat/) - Tox is unique as it uses P2P technology to ensure the network *never* goes down, as long as there are users to keep it alive. They specifically say on the website "Tox has no central servers that can be raided, shut down, or forced to turn over data".
  - [Wire](https://wire.com/en/) - **14-eyes** - Uses end-to-end encryption. Looks to be more of a corporate service with tiered plans.
  - [Riot](https://about.riot.im/) - Open-source privacy-focused chat service with end-to-end encryption. They offer webapps, desktop apps, iOS, and Android (Play Store and F-Droid). Uses the "Matrix" protocol for decentralized communication. It is 100% free and open-source with no paid plans.
  - *Editor note: See [this article](https://outline.com/BK8f7h) for why I didn't include WhatsApp and why you should NOT use it (if someone has a better Outline link, that would be much appreciated).*
- Gmail
  - [Protonmail](https://protonmail.com/) - One of the top privacy-focused email providers. Servers are in Switzerland in an underground guarded bunker that they claim can "survive a nuclear attack". I've used this frequently and it's pretty good.
  - [Tutanota](https://tutanota.com/) - **14-eyes** - Open-source. Also one of the top privacy-focused email providers. Located in Germany.

  - [Airsonic](https://airsonic.github.io/) - **Music only** - Self-hosted open-source media streamer. Has features for transcoding audio on-the-fly for "virtually any audio format". You can also set bandwidth limits if you need to. Looks very powerful.
  - [Music Player Daemon](https://www.musicpd.org/) - A "flexible, powerful, server-side application for playing music".

    - [Debian](https://www.debian.org/)

## Desktop applications

- Chrome
  - [Ungoogled Chromium](https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium) - Chromium (which Chrome and countless other browsers are built on top of) is one of the cleanest and light-weight browsers available. This version cuts out all the Google crap. *Editor note: I've used it for a work project and it's ridiculously fast.*
  - [Firefox](https://firefox.com/) - Built by Mozilla. Huge extension library; great for privacy.
    - [Waterfox](https://www.waterfox.net/) - Based on Firefox, but specifically 64-bit *only* with an emphasis on speed and privacy. Has a "classic" version built off older Firefox for legacy extension support and also an "alpha" version built off Quantum.

  - *Help requested!*
- Android Studio (not specifically for Android development, just in general)

  - *Help requested!*

## Mobile applications (mobile apps installable from stores)

When searching for replacements, check the alternative stores (such as F-Droid) before checking the Play Store.

- Play Store
  - [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) - Catalogue of FOSS apps for Android. Easy to install and keeps track of updates. Also has a browser version if you don't want to install the app.
  - [Aptoide](https://www.aptoide.com/) - Marketplace for Android apps. Publishers/developers manage their own stores rather than a centralized market such as Google Play Store.
  - [Yalp Store](https://github.com/yeriomin/YalpStore) - Yalp downloads Play Store apps as APK files. Helpful if you want to stay away from the Play Store, but require an app that is only available there.
  - [APKMirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/) - An online library of user-uploaded APK files. Helpful if you need a specific older version of an app or don't want to download it through Google Play.
  - [Aurora Store](https://gitlab.com/AuroraOSS/AuroraStore) - Aurora Store is simply a fork of the Yalp Store, but with an updated, cleaner UI. It can also utilize [microG](https://microg.org/) if you wish to use *very minimal* Google Play services.
  - [Fossdroid](https://fossdroid.com/) - Uses the same library as F-Droid, but with a modern UI similar to that of the Play Store and the ability to view apps by popularity.
  - [G-Droid](https://gitlab.com/gdroid/gdroidclient/) - Also uses the F-Droid repo but with a different UI.
  - [APKGrabber](https://github.com/hemker/apkgrabber) - Fork of [APKUpdater](https://github.com/rumboalla/apkupdater). Both are great tools for avoiding app stores (on Android).
  - [Aurora Droid](https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/app-aurora-droid-fdroid-client-t3932663) - Yet another F-Droid client, potentially has a few bugs (thanks u/OfficialJohnGL4)
- Chrome (Android)
  - [Fennec F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.mozilla.fennec_fdroid/) - A privacy-focused version of Firefox Android available on F-Droid. It's focused on removing any proprietary bits found in official Mozilla's builds. (thanks u/SupremeLisper)
  - [Bromite](https://www.bromite.org/) - Privacy-focused/open-source build of Chromium with built-in ad blocking. (thanks u/SupremeLisper)
- Calculator
  - [Simple Calculator](https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools/Simple-Calculator) - Also part of the SMT project. Available on F-Droid.
  - [Calculator N+](https://github.com/tranleduy2000/ncalc) (or NCalc+) - Open-source feature-rich calculator. App itself is no longer in development, but the developer does [encourage pull requests](https://github.com/tranleduy2000/ncalc#calculator-n---powerful-calculator-for-android). I've used it frequently and it works great. Not on F-Droid, but a 3rd party play store can probably find it; or the APK's are available as releases on GitHub. You can also compile from source.
- Calendar
  - [Fruux (mobile app)](https://fruux.com/) - Same service from above provides an Android app.
  - [Etar](https://github.com/xsoh/Etar-Calendar) - Open-source material design Calendar that integrates with the Android Calendar API. If you have a CalDAV/CardDAV server, I recommend using [DAVx5](https://www.davx5.com/) to sync with it. Available from F-Droid. *Editor note: this is the one I am using*
- Clock
  - [Clock +](https://github.com/philliphsu/ClockPlus) - Open-source Alarm clock, timer, and stop watch. Available from F-Droid.
  - [Simple Alarm Clock](https://github.com/yuriykulikov/AlarmClock) - Exactly as it's name says; simple alarm clock yet adds many improvements over other apps. No dock mode or world clock.
  - [Insane Alarm!](https://github.com/RIAEvangelist/insane-alarm) - Developer states that he had "spent a night out with the boys and drank a bit too much but needed to be up in the morning". So, he made the loudest alarm clock possible based off an emergency alarm from when he was in the military. This app doesn't mess around, use it wisely.
- Contacts
  - [Fruux (mobile app)](https://fruux.com/) - Fruux *also* provides a contacts app.
  - [Simple Contacts](https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools/Simple-Contacts) - Open-source. Part of the [Simple Mobile Tools](https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools) project. Available from F-Droid.
  - [Open Contacts](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/opencontacts.open.com.opencontacts/) - Available from F-Droid. (thanks u/consentio)
- Android Messages (specifically SMS, not IM)
  - [QKSMS](https://github.com/moezbhatti/qksms) - Open-source. Very clean and feature rich SMS app.
  - [Silence.im](https://silence.im/) - Open-source and utilizes Signal's encryption protocol. Seamlessly works with SMS. End-to-end encryption with other Silence users.
  - *Both Messages replacements are available on F-Droid*
- Gboard
  - [AnySoftKeyboard](https://anysoftkeyboard.github.io/) - Open-source keyboard. Available on F-Droid.
  - [Hacker's Keyboard](https://github.com/klausw/hackerskeyboard) - Also open-source. Very useful for developers or sysadmins on the go.

  - [Simple Keyboard](https://github.com/rkkr/simple-keyboard) - Open-source, available from F-Droid.

# Useful links, tools, and advice

Everything you need to become Privacy Wizard.

- The [r/Privacy wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/privacy/wiki/index) has a lot of helpful information; I highly recommend reading through it! Seriously, do it now, then come back here.

- Use a [password manager](https://outline.com/pHsALA) to keep all your passwords secure. ~~I use LastPass~~ u/-Choose-A-User- and u/EbonixCo have convinced me to switch to [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/). So far it's just as good, if not better.
- Set up [multi-factor/two-factor authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication) on as many accounts as you can. It may be a pain, but it could save you from a targeted hack.
- Don't save passwords to your browser! [Erase the entire password cache](http://www.wikihow.com/Delete-Remembered-Passwords) once you set up a password manager.

# The lighter side

All that reading got you tired out? Or super interested in nerdy stuff? Awesome, now go check out these.

- Movies and TV I recommend:
  - *Snowden (2016)* - Based on the true story of Edward Snowden, the CIA/NSA/etc whistleblower. I've seen it about 30 times. Directed by Oliver Stone.
  - *Deep Web (2015)* - Documentary (narrated by Keanu Reeves) about Ross Ulbricht aka. Dread Pirate Roberts and the infamous "Silk Road" dark market. Directed by Alex Winter.
  - *Mr. Robot* - Hacker-drama starring Rami Malek. Producers hired actual hackers as consultants to ensure the show is as accurate as possible; real-world tools used in the show.
  - *Silicon Valley* - Satirical tech comedy about a compression startup struggling to take off in Silicon Valley, California. My personal favourite show. Episodes are pure genius, tech humour is actually funny and not forced.
- Podcasts:
  - [Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/) (by Jack Rhysider) - Beautifully crafted, bone-chilling episodes highlighting real-life hackers and their stories. Covers privacy topics a fair bit.
  - The WAN Show (Linus Tech Tips) - Not specifically privacy, but they cover all sorts of tech news.
  - [The Privacy, Security, & OSINT Show](https://inteltechniques.com/podcast.html) - "This weekly podcast presents ideas to help you become digitally invisible, stay secure from cyber threats, and make you a better online investigator."
  - [Security Now!](https://www.grc.com/SecurityNow.htm) - "TechTV's Leo Laporte and I spend somewhat shy of two hours each week to discuss important issues of personal computer security." (Thanks u/Abaddon182)
- Other:
  - [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/) - They have comics for *everything*.
  - System32 Comics [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/system32comics/) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/System32Comics/) - Comedic computer comics.

# Closing remarks

It's a shame that Google, with their immense resources, power, and influence, don't see the benefits of helping people secure themselves online. Instead, they force people like us to scour the web for alternatives and convince our friends and family to do the same, while they sell off our data to the highest bidder.

Hopefully this guide can serve as a starting point for those new to privacy, or be a good refresher for the experts.

Good luck and stay safe!
