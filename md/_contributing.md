If you want to help out with the project, here are some ideas:

- Find more iOS app alternatives
- Provide more information on services with little info or where *help requested!* is shown.
- Suggest new services or provide info for removing existing services.
- Host a mirror or fork the repo. If you host a mirror, let me know and I can add it to the mirrors list.
- Anything else relating to any part of this guide, whether it's Google related or not.
